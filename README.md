# Leetcode_Questions
This directory contains all of the leetcode questions that I have been working on so far. The directory is a massive directory that is in preparation for my knowledge base in the field of Computer Science. 

# What does this repository contain? 
This directory will contain leetcode questions that I have done twice, both in JAVA and in Python. This will allow you to see how the code is written in both of the languages and how my logic is written in code for those two languages specifically. In the future, I hope to be coming back to all of these questions individually and then re-working through them with C and C++. For this repository, we will be covering the following main topics: 

- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion
- Graphs (Shortest Path Questions)
- Trees (Minimum Spanning Trees and Red-Black Trees)
- Network Flow Graphs
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Sorting Algorithms 

Each of the subdirectory will have the questions that I have attempted inside them with a scanned piece of paper to explain my logic or any thoughts I had. The scanned PDF will contain how I thought about solving the problem before coding and after I have coded my work, I wrote what changes were made to any of the logic and approaches that were taken. 

Once you finished viewing through this entire directory, please feel free to have a look at my other repositories and feel free to consider this repository as your study guide for any of your exams if it helps!! 

# How can I run my files? 
Make sure that you git clone the repository and then go ahead to the subdirectory you would like to visit. Utilize ls to figure out all the possible directories in your terminal and then use find and grep functions to find specific files or functions respectively. 

To run a java file, you could do: 
- javac [NAME_OF_FILE].java
- java [NAME_OF_CLASS]

To run a python file, you could do: 
- python [NAME_OF_FILE].py
